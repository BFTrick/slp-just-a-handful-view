# Just a Handful View for Store Locator Plus

## Description

Just a Handful View (JaHV) is an extension for [Store Locator Plus](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/store-locator-plus/). This extension makes it very easy and convenient for users to create a store locator page that is optimized for websites that have a handful of stores. This extension features:

* No search options, everything will appear on one screen
* A consolidated view displaying the results panel right next to the map
* A consolidated results list only showing the location title until the user clicks 

## FAQ

**I don't like that the map is right next to the results list. Can I change it back?**

Yes, you can override the default styles in your theme's style sheet.

**I don't like the consolidated results list. Can you give me all the details by default?**

For right now you can override the CSS in your theme's style sheet. I plan on adding that functionality in administrative section soon.
